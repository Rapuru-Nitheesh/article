            <h2>Kerala's Cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                Kerala’s cuisine is a rich and flavorful tapestry,
                 reflecting the state’s tropical climate, cultural 
                 diversity, and abundant natural resources. The dishes 
                 are characterized by the liberal use of coconut in
                various forms—grated, as milk, or oil—along with                     aromatic spices like black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon,
                and turmeric, which give the food its distinctive
                flavors. Rice is the staple, forming the base for
                meals and appearing in dishes like <i >"appam, puttu,
                and idiyappam"</i>, often paired with spicy curries or 
                coconut-based stews. Seafood plays a prominent role,                    with fresh fish, prawns, crab, and mussels forming
                the heart of many dishes, such as the iconic <i>"karimeen 
                pollichathu" </i>(pearl spot fish grilled in banana leaves), 
               <i> "chemmeen curry"</i> (spicy prawn curry), and fish moilee 
                (mild fish curry in coconut milk).
