                 is renowned for its tropical monsoon climate, which

                 Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats. The state 
                 experiences warm and humid weather throughout 
                 the year, with lush <i >greenery and vibrant ecosystems</i>

                 with temperatures ranging between 28°C and 38°C. 
                This season also witnesses pre-monsoon showers,
                 locally known as <i >"Mango showers"</i> which provide

                 diversity, and abundant natural resources. The dishes
